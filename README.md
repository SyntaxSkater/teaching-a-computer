# Teaching a Computer

I am going to train my computer.

> [!NOTE]
> [Maybe I should make main.py make classes instead of use a database? I wonder if it would be more efficient. The reason: For linguistics as a whole, I make a class for it so I can refer to Linguistics and use methods from it. The only reason I would need to grab from a database would be to grab information on linguistics (maybe something like examples of linguistics). I could just make the class expand and contract based on what it was doing to keep it dynamic with the flow of the program]
